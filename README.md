Title: Elon Musk tells Republican lawmakers he's not to blame for federal firings

Description: Billionaire Elon Musk is telling Republican lawmakers that he is not to blame for the firings of thousands of federal workers, including veterans, as pushes to downsize the government. Instead, he said in private talks this week that those decisions are left to the various federal agencies.

The message from one of President Donald Trump's most influential advisers came as Republicans publicly support Musk's work at the Department of Government Efficiency digging up waste, fraud and abuse, but are privately raising questions as personnel cuts ripple through communities across the nation.

"Elon doesn't fire people," said Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., after a dinner-time pizza meeting with Musk in the basement of the Capitol.

"He doesn't have hiring and firing authority," added Hudson, who leads the House Republicans' campaign arm. "The president's empowered him to go uncover this information, that's it."

It's a remarkable shift of emphasis away from the chainsaw-wielding tech entrepreneur whose vast power has made him an admired, revered and deeply feared figure in the second Trump administration.

The Republican president weighed in Thursday after a Cabinet meeting, saying he has instructed department secretaries to work with DOGE but to "be very precise" about which workers will stay or go -- using a "'scalpel'" he said in a social media post "rather than the 'hatchet."

"I don't want to see a big cut where a lot of good people are cut," Trump later told reporters in the Oval Office.

Trump suggested that Cabinet and agency leaders would take the lead, but Musk could push harder down the line.

"If they can cut, it's better. And if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting."

He had said in the earlier post that Musk and Cabinet officials will meet every two weeks to advance their cost-cutting goals

The comments come amid mounting legal disputes over Musk's attempts to centralize management of the government workforce and bypass the traditional role of Congress to appropriate federal dollars.

For example, the White House's Office of Personnel Management directed federal agencies to fire probationary workers, who lack full civil service protection. The scorched-earth approach led to deep cuts that have occasionally been reversed, such as when workers on nuclear weapons programs were brought back on the job.

A federal judge in San Francisco expressed concerns that layoffs violated the law, leading administration officials to insist that it was individual agencies -- not Musk or the Office of Personnel Management -- calling the shots.

Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., said Musk told lawmakers that "some of the folks that were the probationary people, he didn't fire them, they were actually supposedly fired by the agencies -- and they messed up."

Did Musk actually say "they messed up?"

"Well, if they were in fact, you know, critical people, and the agency did the firing, then yeah, they messed up," Gimenez said. "But not him."

Musk and his team have burrowed into agencies, accessing sensitive data and rattling career officials with their demands. Top officials, including at the Social Security Administration, abruptly stepped down after refusing to comply with Musk's team. Tens of thousands of workers accepted an offer to resign early and more are facing potential layoffs.

"We're making good progress," Musk said late Wednesday as he dashed through the halls of the Capitol.

The richest person in the world, Musk is known as a driven, demanding executive who is willing to take bold risks, often with great rewards. His enterprises include the rocket company SpaceX, electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla and social media platform X, known the world over.

But his perch at DOGE is Musk's first public foray into the grit of governing. The speed and scale of the cuts, which are being challenged in dozens of court cases, are introducing businessman to the concept of political blowback.

When the topic of the fired federal workers came up during a Senate lunch, Musk deflected blame.

"I would say that there was an argument that that's not coming from DOGE, it's actually coming from individual agencies," said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.

Another Republican, Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, said that Musk went so far as to emphasize that not only had DOGE not recommended mass termination of probationary employees, but that he thought some federal agencies were either incompetent or sabotaging the effort. Musk told them he wanted more precise terminations of those not performing.

"The point that he was making is that DOGE had not made recommendations for across-the-board cuts of all probationary employees at every agency," Barr said.

"But the agencies had implemented it improperly through either incompetence or in a handful of cases actual malicious efforts to sabotage and create a public relations problem for DOGE."

In fact, scores of fired workers are being recalled back to work across the federal agencies. This week, about 180 employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were being told they could come back, in an email that said: "Read this email immediately."

Musk was invited to Capitol Hill this week by Trump's allies and party leaders to provide more information to lawmakers facing questions about the DOGE cuts. Many Republicans are being hammered at town halls back home, so much so that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has encouraged them to meet with constituents in other venues.

Musk gave his cellphone number to the senators -- though not the members of the House -- and his team is setting up a dedicated phone line the lawmakers can call if they have further questions, complaints or suggestions about his work, and about jobs and agencies that should be spared.

Democrats, and their allies in outside advocacy groups, have been highlighting the way the cutbacks will hurt Americans.

On Thursday, 141 House Democrats led by Virginia Rep. Gerald Connolly, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, urged the OPM to reinstate all the probationary employees who have been unlawfully terminated.

"We write in strong opposition to the expansion of the Trump Administration's efforts to purge nonpartisan civil servants from the federal workforce, specifically recent unlawful mass terminations of employees in probationary status," wrote the lawmakers in a letter to the office's acting director, Charles Ezell.

"Indiscriminately firing thousands of these employees threatens the future of the nonpartisan federal workforce and our government's ability to deliver life-saving services to the American people."

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said that if the White House wants to abolish an entire agency such as the Department of Education, "Bring the bill to Congress. We welcome that fight."

Jeffries added: "We'll stand on the side of the American people, and they'll continue to stand on the side of Elon Musk."

Description: Raw Story - 'This is huge': Steve Bannon celebrates as Elon Musk gets his 'wings clipped' by Trump

Erik De La Garza

March 6, 2025 6:49PM ET

MAGA influencer Steve Bannon heaped praise on reports that Elon Musk was reduced to a public dressing down by President Donald Trump, who cut the tech billionaire's power to fire federal workers in his capacity as chair of the Department of Government Efficiency.

"This is huge," Bannon proclaimed. "This has now come to a head of DOGE."

The latest pot-shot in the simmering feud between the two top Trump allies erupted Thursday following reports that Trump called his cabinet together to deliver the message to the tech billionaire, whose mass firings have drawn criticism from lawmakers on Capitol Hill and outrage from Americans.

"He had his wings clipped," Bannon said Thursday on his "War Room" podcast. "He was told point blank by the president in front of people - only department heads - only my cabinet officials or the heads of these alphabet agencies can actually fire people, you're a consultant advisor you have to go to them and do it."

Bannon, a former White House strategist, gleefully added that "the president took it down even a notch from there."

Description: President Trump told his Cabinet members on Thursday that they are in charge of staff reductions, not Elon Musk, amid continuing questions over the billionaire adviser's role in a drastic reshaping of the federal government.

Trump said he'd told his Cabinet as much in a closed-door meeting with most of his secretaries, which Musk also attended.

"I don't want to see a big cut where a lot of good people are cut. I want the Cabinet members to keep the good people, and the people that aren't doing a good job, that are unreliable, don't show up to work, etc., those people can be cut," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

"If they can cut, it's better. And if they don't cut then Elon will do the cutting," the president said.

Musk is the public face of the Trump administration's efforts to slash federal spending and staffing through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which despite its name is not an actual federal agency. However, the White House says Musk is not the administrator of DOGE but instead a "special government employee" who advises the president and has no power to set policy.

The opacity over who is leading DOGE and what authority Musk wields has fueled criticism and legal challenges to DOGE and to mass firings carried out at many agencies. Trump himself added to the confusion when he said in his address to Congress this week that DOGE is "headed" by Musk.

On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told CNN that while Musk's goals and objectives are right, agency leaders are "probably better attuned to the individual programs."

The Trump administration is planning further widespread reductions in force across federal agencies. In a social media post on Thursday, Trump wrote: "[N]ow that we have my Cabinet in place, I have instructed the Secretaries and Leadership to work with DOGE on Cost Cutting measures and Staffing. As the Secretaries learn about, and understand, the people working for the various Departments, they can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go. We say the 'scalpel' rather than the 'hatchet.'"

Trump added: "It's very important that we cut levels down to where they should be, but it's also important to keep the best and most productive people."

While Bannon made clear that he was "a huge supporter of DOGE," he said it couldn't continue "in just darkness."

The former Trump adviser concluded that Musk having his powers limited by the president was "pretty brutal."

Title: Donald Trump warns his Cabinet that Elon Musk, DOGE 'are gonna be watching them'
Source: Yahoo

URL: https://www.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-warns-cabinet-elon-223349103.html
Description: President Donald Trump said on Thursday in the Oval Office that he wants his Cabinet to "keep good people" - and earlier behind closed doors, he reportedly made his most forceful separation from Elon Musk's effort to make sweeping cuts to the federal government.

Musk, the billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, has wielded unprecedented authority as a special government employee in implementing mass firings, canceling billions of dollars in contracts and programs and gaining access to sensitive computer systems.

Multiple news outlets reported that Trump held a Cabinet-level meeting Thursday morning and told high-level officials that they are in charge of their agencies and departments, and not Musk.

Still, during Trump's later Oval Office remarks, he issued a clear warning that "we're going to be watching" federal officials and that "if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting."

He added, "We want them to keep the good people. And so, we're gonna be watching them. And Elon and the group are gonna be watching them. And if they can cut, it's better. And if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting."

The Department of Government Efficiency's efforts have cut more than 100,000 employees from the 2.3 million-strong federal workforce. In some cases, the government has scrambled to rehire critical staffers in areas such as nuclear weapons security and bird flu research.

Trump said from the Oval Office, "I want the Cabinet members to keep the good people, and the people that aren't doing a good job, that are unreliable, don't show up to work, et cetera, those people can be cut."

His comments came as the president also posted about Thursday's Cabinet huddle - and his ongoing approach to slashing the federal government, a key campaign promise - on his social media platform Truth Social.

"It's very important that we cut levels down to where they should be, but it's also important to keep the best and most productive people," Trump wrote in the post. "We say the 'scalpel' rather than the 'hatchet.'"

Title: Donald Trump tells his Cabinet that Elon Musk isn't allowed to fire federal workers anymore

URL: https://www.themarysue.com/donald-trump-tells-his-cabinet-that-elon-musk-isnt-allowed-to-fire-federal-workers-anymore/
Description: In a surprising turn of events, Donald Trump appears to be scaling back Elon Musk's power. He reportedly told his Cabinet members that Musk isn't allowed to fire federal workers anymore and can only advise on layoffs.

His clarification of Musk's role seems to have come a little late, considering Musk, through his so-called DOGE department, has already laid off thousands of federal workers. In the name of government savings, he has purged employees from multiple departments and agencies ranging from USAID to the FAA to the National Park Service. Musk appeared to circumvent department heads and HR, allowing him to "accidentally" dismiss vital workers for the Nuclear National Security Administration and USDA employees working on the government's response to bird flu and potentially compromise CIA agents by demanding a list of agents' names for layoff purposes. He even threatened to personally fire anyone across the government who didn't respond to an email demanding they justify their jobs. However, he later walked back that threat after departments pushed back, including Trump's cabinet members Kash Patel and Tulsi Gabbard.

Trump, though, finally seems to be recognizing the murky legal water Musk is wading into with his indiscriminate mass firings.

Trump has reportedly informed his Cabinet that Musk is no longer allowed to carry out federal workforce layoffs. Two administration officials told Politico the message was relayed in a meeting with his Cabinet, in which Trump reminded them they're in charge of their departments, not Musk. According to the sources, Musk was also present for the meeting and seemed to agree with the directive.

During the meeting, he allegedly told his Cabinet that Musk is only to serve an "advisory" role in the government. Hence, he can provide guidance and recommendations to these departments, but it's ultimately up to department heads to make final decisions on "personnel, policy, and the pacing of implementation." On TruthSocial, Trump confirmed that the Cabinet meeting took place. He also mentioned that DOGE's indiscriminate mass firings may come to an end, as he mentioned wanting Secretaries to use a "scalpel" instead of a "hatchet" when firing workers and to choose who to let go in a more "precise" manner.

Given that Trump just a few weeks ago signed an executive order giving DOGE more power, many are likely wondering what changed in his perspective of Musk. The most probable explanation is that legal advisors finally convinced him he was in hot water with Musk. The American government has rules to prevent un-elected bureaucrats from gaining power, such as requiring an act of Congress to create departments or requiring all Cabinet nominees to go through the Senate for approval. However, Trump blatantly defied all these rules when he created an unofficial government department, DOGE, and made Musk the head of it, giving him Cabinet-level power (or, as some may argue, even presidential-level power) without any input or oversight from the other branches of government.

Unsurprisingly, Trump was sued by 14 states and over a dozen USAID employees for the illegal power he gave Musk. The White House has been slowly pursuing damage control, claiming that Musk isn't the head of DOGE and is just a presidential advisor. However, this is the first time Trump actually laid out rules limiting Musk to an advisory role with his top administration officials.

The new directive still has a huge, glaring problem: Musk has already fired tens of thousands of federal workers. It remains unclear if all of these workers will be rehired now or if the Trump administration will start claiming that Musk and DOGE just advised all these people to be indiscriminately fired but didn't actually make the final decision.

Title: Elon Musk tells Republican lawmakers he's not to blame for federal firings

Description: WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's not his fault.

Billionaire Elon Musk is telling Republican lawmakers that he is not to blame for the firings of thousands of federal workers, including veterans, as pushes to downsize the government. Instead, he said in private talks this week that those decisions are left to the various federal agencies.

The message from one of President Donald Trump's most influential advisers came as Republicans publicly support Musk's work at the Department of Government Efficiency digging up waste, fraud and abuse, but are privately raising questions as personnel cuts ripple through communities across the nation.

"Elon doesn't fire people," said Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., after a dinner-time pizza meeting with Musk in the basement of the Capitol.

"He doesn't have hiring and firing authority," added Hudson, who leads the House Republicans' campaign arm. "The president's empowered him to go uncover this information, that's it."

It's a remarkable shift of emphasis away from the chainsaw-wielding tech entrepreneur whose vast power has made him an admired, revered and deeply feared figure in the second Trump administration.

The Republican president weighed in Thursday after a Cabinet meeting, saying he has instructed department secretaries to work with DOGE but to "be very precise" about which workers will stay or go -- using a "'scalpel'" he said in a social media post "rather than the 'hatchet."

"I don't want to see a big cut where a lot of good people are cut," Trump later told reporters in the Oval Office.

Trump suggested that Cabinet and agency leaders would take the lead, but Musk could push harder down the line.

"If they can cut, it's better. And if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting."

He had said in the earlier post that Musk and Cabinet officials will meet every two weeks to advance their cost-cutting goals

The comments come amid mounting legal disputes over Musk's attempts to centralize management of the government workforce and bypass the traditional role of Congress to appropriate federal dollars.

For example, the White House's Office of Personnel Management directed federal agencies to fire probationary workers, who lack full civil service protection. The scorched-earth approach led to deep cuts that have occasionally been reversed, such as when workers on nuclear weapons programs were brought back on the job.

A federal judge in San Francisco expressed concerns that layoffs violated the law, leading administration officials to insist that it was individual agencies -- not Musk or the Office of Personnel Management -- calling the shots.

Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., said Musk told lawmakers that "some of the folks that were the probationary people, he didn't fire them, they were actually supposedly fired by the agencies -- and they messed up."

Did Musk actually say "they messed up?"

"Well, if they were in fact, you know, critical people, and the agency did the firing, then yeah, they messed up," Gimenez said. "But not him."

Musk and his team have burrowed into agencies, accessing sensitive data and rattling career officials with their demands. Top officials, including at the Social Security Administration, abruptly stepped down after refusing to comply with Musk's team. Tens of thousands of workers accepted an offer to resign early and more are facing potential layoffs.

"We're making good progress," Musk said late Wednesday as he dashed through the halls of the Capitol.

The richest person in the world, Musk is known as a driven, demanding executive who is willing to take bold risks, often with great rewards. His enterprises include the rocket company SpaceX, electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla and social media platform X, known the world over.

But his perch at DOGE is Musk's first public foray into the grit of governing. The speed and scale of the cuts, which are being challenged in dozens of court cases, are introducing businessman to the concept of political blowback.

When the topic of the fired federal workers came up during a Senate lunch, Musk deflected blame.

"I would say that there was an argument that that's not coming from DOGE, it's actually coming from individual agencies," said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.

Another Republican, Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, said that Musk went so far as to emphasize that not only had DOGE not recommended mass termination of probationary employees, but that he thought some federal agencies were either incompetent or sabotaging the effort. Musk told them he wanted more precise terminations of those not performing.

"The point that he was making is that DOGE had not made recommendations for across-the-board cuts of all probationary employees at every agency," Barr said.

"But the agencies had implemented it improperly through either incompetence or in a handful of cases actual malicious efforts to sabotage and create a public relations problem for DOGE."

In fact, scores of fired workers are being recalled back to work across the federal agencies. This week, about 180 employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were being told they could come back, in an email that said: "Read this email immediately."

Musk was invited to Capitol Hill this week by Trump's allies and party leaders to provide more information to lawmakers facing questions about the DOGE cuts. Many Republicans are being hammered at town halls back home, so much so that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has encouraged them to meet with constituents in other venues.

Musk gave his cellphone number to the senators -- though not the members of the House -- and his team is setting up a dedicated phone line the lawmakers can call if they have further questions, complaints or suggestions about his work, and about jobs and agencies that should be spared.

Democrats, and their allies in outside advocacy groups, have been highlighting the way the cutbacks will hurt Americans.

On Thursday, 141 House Democrats led by Virginia Rep. Gerald Connolly, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, urged the OPM to reinstate all the probationary employees who have been unlawfully terminated.

"We write in strong opposition to the expansion of the Trump Administration's efforts to purge nonpartisan civil servants from the federal workforce, specifically recent unlawful mass terminations of employees in probationary status," wrote the lawmakers in a letter to the office's acting director, Charles Ezell.

"Indiscriminately firing thousands of these employees threatens the future of the nonpartisan federal workforce and our government's ability to deliver life-saving services to the American people."

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said that if the White House wants to abolish an entire agency such as the Department of Education, "Bring the bill to Congress. We welcome that fight."

Jeffries added: "We'll stand on the side of the American people, and they'll continue to stand on the side of Elon Musk."

Title: Is Elon Musk's DOGE here for long run or is Trump preparing to jettison the project?

Description: President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have been on the same page as the Department of Government Efficiency project continues tearing through federal agencies, mothballing some departments while also overseeing federal workforce layoffs. But it remains to be seen whether they can stay on good terms, and whether DOGE can stick around long-term.

With Trump's support, DOGE began ripping out parts of the administrative state -- first freezing some $2 billion in funds to the United States Agency for International Development, which the U.S. Supreme Court rejected. And then Musk's engineers instituted mass layoffs. Some of the employees are being asked to come back while courts hold up other layoffs.

Musk initially promised his efforts would lead to about $2 trillion in spending cuts; he eventually hedged his pledge, saying savings would come in around $1 trillion. But there are questions whether he can land on that number within a year.

As of March 3, DOGE has claimed savings of $105 billion from a combination of lease terminations, contract cancellations and firing workers. That's the equivalent of about four pennies for every dollar the federal government has spent since the start of this fiscal year, according to a new NPR analysis.

DOGE has also deleted several of the biggest spending cuts the non-governmental agency celebrated in February. The cuts contained several mistakes, leading engineers to misunderstand the level of spending on some of the programs they were slashing.

To put the overall numbers into perspective, from Oct. 1, 2024, through Jan. 31, 2025, the federal government pulled in $1.6 trillion and spent $2.4 trillion, leaving a deficit of nearly $840 billion.

Budget hawks say the only way to eat into spending is by taking a hatchet to non-discretionary spending -- like the Social Security Trust Fund, which includes Medicare. Lawmakers would also have to tackle Medicaid. So far, Trump has been unwilling to touch these programs.

Musk attended Trump's first cabinet meeting on February 26th, despite not being a member of the team. At the time, the president gave his fellow billionaire a vote of confidence by warning his cabinet members to follow DOGE's lead.

"Is anybody unhappy with Elon?" Trump said during the meeting to laughs from those in attendance. "If you are, we'll throw him out of here. Is anybody unhappy? They have a lot of respect for Elon and that he's doing this," he told a reporter who asked if his cabinet members are happy with the arrangement.

The White House is now -- less than a month later -- reportedly allowing agency heads to push back a bit more.

Trump told administration officials that Musk can make recommendations to their departments but not issue unilateral decisions, according to Politico, citing White House sources. It's the first example of the president narrowing DOGE's mandate. The president confirmed aspects of the report on his Truth Social on Thursday.

Musk was reportedly in the room when the interactions took place, and, while there, he acknowledged making some missteps -- a message he shared earlier with members of Congress.

The report followed several town hall meetings around the country where congressional Republicans were pelted with pointed questions about DOGE. The dust up prompted House Republican leadership to direct lawmakers to avoid in-person events going forward.

Whether DOGE's work can stand the test of time and cement itself into the fabric of future administrations remains to be seen. There are indications that whatever the project does going forward could have long-lasting impacts. Take, for example, efforts to cull down the federal workforce.

Building up administrative capacity often takes legislative action, meaning it could be years before the government regains pre-Trump staff levels. Tens of thousands of employees have been let go in the first month and a half of the president's second term.

Efforts at selling off federal buildings could also stand the test of time. The administration published a list of more than 440 properties the GSA considered possibly selling, including the FBI headquarters and the main Justice Department building

A revised list was reportedly published hours later with only 320 entries, which excluded every previously listed building in Washington, D.C. By Wednesday morning, the list was gone entirely, according to the Associated Press. On the web page was a notification of a new list coming soon.

Most of DOGE's work is done through executive order, which means future presidents can undue and dismantle Musk's project through orders of their own. Trump would need to request Congress make the project permanent through law before his second term expires.

Title: Donald Trump warns his Cabinet that Elon Musk, DOGE 'are gonna be watching them'

Description: President Donald Trump said on Thursday in the Oval Office that he wants his Cabinet to "keep good people" - and earlier behind closed doors, he reportedly made his most forceful separation from Elon Musk's effort to make sweeping cuts to the federal government.

Musk, the billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, has wielded unprecedented authority as a special government employee in implementing mass firings, canceling billions of dollars in contracts and programs and gaining access to sensitive computer systems.

Multiple news outlets reported that Trump held a Cabinet-level meeting Thursday morning and told high-level officials that they are in charge of their agencies and departments, and not Musk.

Still, during Trump's later Oval Office remarks, he issued a clear warning that "we're going to be watching" federal officials and that "if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting."

He added, "We want them to keep the good people. And so, we're gonna be watching them. And Elon and the group are gonna be watching them. And if they can cut, it's better. And if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting."

The Department of Government Efficiency's efforts have cut more than 100,000 employees from the 2.3 million-strong federal workforce. In some cases, the government has scrambled to rehire critical staffers in areas such as nuclear weapons security and bird flu research.

Trump said from the Oval Office, "I want the Cabinet members to keep the good people, and the people that aren't doing a good job, that are unreliable, don't show up to work, et cetera, those people can be cut."

His comments came as the president also posted about Thursday's Cabinet huddle - and his ongoing approach to slashing the federal government, a key campaign promise - on his social media platform Truth Social.

"It's very important that we cut levels down to where they should be, but it's also important to keep the best and most productive people," Trump wrote in the post. "We say the 'scalpel' rather than the 'hatchet.'"

Title: Is Elon Musk getting paid for DOGE? And what is his title?

Description: In his speech, Trump again said the department is "headed" by billionaire Elon Musk.

Does Elon Musk run DOGE?

The White House has offered contradictory statements on who is running the agency tasked with eliminating so-called wasteful spending in the U.S. federal government.

The "acting administrator" of DOGE is a low-profile executive who has expertise in health care technology and worked in the first Trump administration. The White House in late February identified Amy Gleason as the acting leader of DOGE, which has been pushing agencies to fire employees, cancel contracts and make other budget cuts.

Potential conflicts of interest?

Although DOGE's cuts have been championed by Musk and his associates, the White House has insisted Musk is overseeing the effort as a senior adviser to the president, not a DOGE employee.

Musk, the world's richest person, does not draw a government salary and operates as a "special government employee," the White House has said. It has been vague on Musk's exact role in DOGE.

Democrats on the House Oversight Committee are introducing a pair of resolutions demanding the Trump administration turn over documents and information about Musk's potential conflicts of interest and the firings of federal workers, according to The Associated Press.

The resolution from Democratic Rep. Gerald Connolly of Virginia would launch an investigation into Musk himself over potential conflicts of interest.

Musk's companies receive hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. Tesla had already received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.

Salaries at DOGE

While Musk works to gut federal agencies, DOGE staffers are reportedly making six-figure salaries.

Business and technology magazine Wired reported that Jeremy Lewin, who was instrumental in dismantling USAID, makes over $167,000 per year. Kyle Schutt, a software engineer working within the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, takes home $195,200, according to Wired, which did not disclose its source for these figures.

Wired reported that several other DOGE staffers also receive six-figure government-funded salaries, while others appeared to be unpaid volunteers.

A recruitment page for potential DOGE employees also indicates that workers are compensated, despite Musk's earlier claim that the pay for DOGE staffers is "zero."

Elon Musk, whom President Donald Trump said in the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), offered an abbreviated description of a Trump Cabinet meeting he attended on Thursday.

Musk and DOGE, tasked with drastically curtailing government spending, have been under fire during the early days of Trump's second term for enacting controversial cost-cutting measures at federal agencies, attempting to access personal information on government databases and initiating mass firings of federal workers.

Pushback against the tech billionaire, the world's richest man, has come from Democrats and Republicans, with some referring to Musk as the "real" president and arguing that his actions amount to an abuse of power by an unelected de facto federal official.

Musk said in a post to X, formerly Twitter, which he owns, that Thursday's encounter with Trump and Cabinet members was a "very productive meeting." Musk's remarks were made while sharing part of a Truth Social post by Trump, who touted the "incredible success" of DOGE while describing a "very positive" meeting.

"We just had a meeting with most of the Secretaries, Elon, and others, and it was a very positive one," Trump wrote. "It's very important that we cut levels down to where they should be, but it's also important to keep the best and most productive people. We're going to have these meetings every two weeks until that aspect of this very necessary job is done.

"The relationships between everybody in that room are extraordinary. They all want to get to the exact same place, which is, simply, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

Title: Elon Musk gave GOP senators his number. Just don't ask them about it.

Description: Having a direct line to Musk is a hot commodity in the age of DOGE.

Republican senators just got their hands on Elon Musk's cell phone number, giving them a direct line to the man who's been reshaping the federal bureaucracy at President Donald Trump's behest.

Many of them don't want to talk about it.

"I'm not gonna answer that question, okay? What's your next one?" Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said. "I don't think it's anyone's business."

Business Insider approached half a dozen Republican senators at the Capitol on Thursday to ask them if they've had any text conversations with Musk, or whether they anticipate doing so in the future. Only one -- Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina -- confirmed CNN's reporting that Musk gave out his number during a lunch with most Senate Republicans on Wednesday.

"I haven't texted with him. I don't have a need to do that," Tillis told BI, adding that if DOGE is "going into any areas where we're looking at potential job impacts or other impacts, I know I can give him a call."

Having the power to call up Musk is a precious commodity in the age of DOGE, with the promise of influencing the man who's been working with a team of lieutenants to shutter whole agencies, access sensitive systems, and choke off streams of federal funding -- all without the formal input of Congress. At times, his power has seemed to exceed that of Cabinet secretaries and rival that of Trump himself.

Perhaps that's why some GOP senators don't want to even acknowledge whether they were offered his number.

"I'm not getting into all that. If you have a policy question, I'm happy to answer that," Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told BI. "That's all I got for you. Sorry."

"I'm not gonna confirm or deny that," Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri told BI. "I've met with him twice in the last two weeks. He's been very accessible."

There's also an awareness of the power that Musk -- not just the de facto head of DOGE, but the owner of what may be the world's most important communication platform, X -- holds relative to them. And some of them don't hide their own sense of awe at the Tesla and SpaceX CEO.

Sen. Ted Cruz did not confirm or deny that Musk gave out his number on Wednesday. But the Texas Republican said he's had Musk's number for years and that he's a "good friend." When asked what the billionaire businessman is like over text, Cruz launched into a two-and-a-half minute-long disquisition about Musk's brilliance and business acumen.

Title: Mike Johnson has begun preaching the gospel of Elon Musk

Description: Back in 2017, former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski garnered headlines when he formally established a religious group that worshipped artificial intelligence.

The so-called Way of the Future's mission is "to develop and promote the realization of a Godhead based on artificial intelligence and through understanding and worship of the Godhead contribute to the betterment of society." Sounds eerie, right? But it's not unique in being a spiritual ideology centered on technology. In the 1990s, the term "technopaganism" emerged as a definition for those who've made technology a centerpiece of their religious ethos.

All of this came to mind for me this week, when House Speaker Mike Johnson touted "algorithms" that Elon Musk is purportedly using to determine which parts of the federal government should be slashed.

"We meet late into the night in his office, and we've looked at that. What he's finding with his algorithms crawling through the data of Social Security system is enormous amounts of fraud, waste and abuse," Johnson told NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday.

He's publicly gushed about those "algorithms" in the past, and as was the case then, his claim on "Meet the Press" sounded pretty nonsensical. In reality, no one aside from, perhaps, Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency aides he's deployed to gut the federal government appears to know any details about the algorithms being used to make these determinations. But the House speaker's deference to Musk's algorithms sounded almost spiritual -- as if he were speaking of some infallible, inhuman force whose decisions are prudent and final, even if incomprehensible by mere mortals. Tech writers have warned that Silicon Valley's obsession with AI resembles a religion. And now that religion seems to be pervading the federal government.

Just trust in the algorithms, we're encouraged. Have faith in them.

These are dangerous notions, considering what we know about the possibility for algorithms to mete out all kinds of bias and discrimination across federal agencies, like the IRS, and in the housing industry overseen by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. And Musk's xAI company has set out to build an AI chatbot free of "woke ideology" on issues of racial and social justice, Business Insider reported last week, citing internal documents obtained by the outlet. (A spokesperson for xAI did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.)

So there's no reason to believe Musk's algorithms -- either for commercial use or to slash the federal workforce -- have been or will be effective in avoiding bias. Nor is there reason to believe the Trump administration, currently on a warpath against diversity, has any interest in doing so.

And unfortunately, the federal government seems likely to become more reliant on algorithms in the coming years of the Trump presidency. In January, OpenAI, the company led by Sam Altman -- who personally donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee -- unveiled ChatGPT Gov, an artificial intelligence chatbot meant to be used within government agencies. And DOGE has been working on an AI chatbot for the U.S. Government Services Administration, which it's calling GSAi, Wired reported in February, citing two people familiar with the project. (Neither the White House nor GSA responded to Wired's requests for comment.) And one needn't look any further than social media platforms like Musk-owned X and Meta-owned Instagram to see how mysterious algorithms are manipulating our personal lives, as well.

It's as if Washington, D.C., under Trump has found a new, tech-centered religion in its embrace of algorithms. And conservative lawmakers like Mike Johnson are acting as shameless evangelists.

Title: Elon Musk's PAC is running ads touting Trump's accomplishments -- and his

Description: The political action committee that Elon Musk funded to the tune of more than $200 million on behalf of President Donald Trump launched a television advertisement this week lauding the first weeks of the administration in which the Tesla CEO is serving.

America PAC began airing an ad nationally and in Washington, D.C., declaring that with former President Joe Biden's departure, "our long national nightmare is finally over, and with Trump, "America is back."

The 60-second spot hails Trump's moves on immigration, energy and "slashing billions in waste at home," a nod to the purge of the federal workforce Musk has led as head of the Department of Government Efficiency. The ad is heavy on patriotic imagery, with a soundtrack of swelling brass and images of Trump saluting military and greeting supporters.

Rarely if ever has a White House adviser funded an outside organization promoting his accomplishments. It's the latest example of Musk's singular role in American politics, leading an effort to shutter agencies and fire thousands of workers inside the Trump administration while promoting the president's politics outside.

Another Musk-funded group, Building America's Future, is underwriting ads in the race to fill a potentially decisive seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The April 1 election for that judgeship is likely to be the first major test of both Republican and Democratic influence since Trump's victory in November. The same group ran ads last year, including one aimed at Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, urging confirmation of Trump's secretary of defense nominee Pete Hegseth.

Musk has endorsed the idea of supporting primary challenges for Republicans who waver in their support for Trump's Cabinet and agenda.

Though America PAC's ad focuses squarely on Trump, Musk figures prominently, seen holding his young son X and looking on as Trump speaks during an Oval Office briefing.

The spot also features a clip taken last week of Trump sitting alongside Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a testy meeting between the two over U.S. support for the country's fight against Russia's 2022 invasion.

During the clip, the narrator states Trump is "returning power to our military as he seeks to stop the endless wars across the globe."

America PAC is "out with its first ever TV ad, airing across the country this week following @realDonaldTrump's joint address to Congress," America PAC spokesman Andrew Romeo said in a post on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter before Musk purchased it.

America PAC last year spent aggressively on digital and in-person efforts in several states to reach and urge less-frequent voters to vote. The group hired canvassing firms to knock on doors and engage voters in key precincts in battleground states to motivate Trump-friendly voters.

Whether or not the effort made the difference against Democrat Kamala Harris, Trump did carry all seven battleground states, where contractors for Musk's group were active in canvassing voters.

Trump has given Musk wide-ranging access to the administration's inner workings, beyond the effort to shrink the federal workforce and agency spending with which he has been specifically tasked.

Musk has also been privy to talks with administration nominees and, last week, joined Trump at his first Cabinet meeting.

Title: Trump Convenes Cabinet To Tell Them What Elon Musk's Job Actually Is

Description: President Donald Trump convened his cabinet on Thursday to discuss the Department of Government Efficiency being run by Elon Musk and how it needs to start working with the federal agencies, he announced via a TruthSocial post.

Since taking office, Musk's DOGE has dominated the headlines as he has gone from agency to agency with his team auditing department spending and employee efficiency. In late February, Musk instructed federal employees to provide him a list of five things they accomplished during the last week, but some department and agency heads instructed their staff to ignore the emails. Trump told his cabinet and Musk that they need to work on "cost cutting measures and staffing," according to his Truth Social post. (RELATED: Lawyers Already Trying To Use Trump's Address To Congress As 'New Evidence' Against DOGE)

"As the Secretaries learn about, and understand, the people working for the various Departments, they can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go," Trump wrote. "We say the 'scalpel' rather than the 'hatchet.' The combination of them, Elon, DOGE and other great people will be able to do things at a historic level."

Trump told his cabinet that Musk can make recommendations for departments but does not have the power to fire people or make unilateral decisions on policy or personnel, two administration officials told Politico.

"We just had a meeting with most of the Secretaries, Elon, and others, and it was a very positive one. It's very important that we cut levels down to where they should be, but it's also important to keep the best and most productive people," Trump said, adding that these meetings would be happening every two weeks and Musk's relationships with the secretaries is "extraordinary."

"They all want to get to the exact same place, which is, simply, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" Trump continued.

According to a February Harvard CAPS / Harris poll, 72% of voters are supportive of having a government agency focused on efficiency initiatives. Even more voters, 77%, say "a full examination of all government expenditures is necessary" and 70% believe that government expenditures are filled with "waste, fraud and inefficiency," the poll shows.

The survey was conducted among 2,443 registered voters within the United States between Feb. 19-20. The respondents were recruited through an opt-in, web-panel recruitment sampling and the margin of error is 2 points.

Trump did voice his happiness with DOGE and Musk during his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, shouting out the leader who was sitting in the chamber.

Title: Don't ask GOP senators about their texts with Elon Musk
Source: Business Insider
Published: 2025-03-06T21:55:34Z
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-texting-republican-senators-2025-3
Description: Having a direct line to Musk is a hot commodity in the age of DOGE.

Republican senators just got their hands on Elon Musk's cell phone number, giving them a direct line to the man who's been reshaping the federal bureaucracy at President Donald Trump's behest.

Many of them don't want to talk about it.

"I'm not gonna answer that question, okay? What's your next one?" Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said. "I don't think it's anyone's business."

Business Insider approached half a dozen Republican senators at the Capitol on Thursday to ask them if they've had any text conversations with Musk, or whether they anticipate doing so in the future. Only one -- Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina -- confirmed CNN's reporting that Musk gave out his number during a lunch with most Senate Republicans on Wednesday.

"I haven't texted with him. I don't have a need to do that," Tillis told BI, adding that if DOGE is "going into any areas where we're looking at potential job impacts or other impacts, I know I can give him a call."

Having the power to call up Musk is a precious commodity in the age of DOGE, with the promise of influencing the man who's been working with a team of lieutenants to shutter whole agencies, access sensitive systems, and choke off streams of federal funding -- all without the formal input of Congress. At times, his power has seemed to exceed that of Cabinet secretaries and rival that of Trump himself.

Perhaps that's why some GOP senators don't want to even acknowledge whether they were offered his number.

"I'm not getting into all that. If you have a policy question, I'm happy to answer that," Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told BI. "That's all I got for you. Sorry."

"I'm not gonna confirm or deny that," Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri told BI. "I've met with him twice in the last two weeks. He's been very accessible."

There's also an awareness of the power that Musk -- not just the de facto head of DOGE, but the owner of what may be the world's most important communication platform, X -- holds relative to them. And some of them don't hide their own sense of awe at the Tesla and SpaceX CEO.

Sen. Ted Cruz did not confirm or deny that Musk gave out his number on Wednesday. But the Texas Republican said he's had Musk's number for years and that he's a "good friend." When asked what the billionaire businessman is like over text, Cruz launched into a two-and-a-half minute-long disquisition about Musk's brilliance and business acumen.

"If you assume that intelligence is distributed on a bell curve there are roughly 8 billion people on Planet Earth, somebody has to be at the bleeding edge of the bell curve, and his name is Elon," Cruz said. "I have been blessed to know many really smart people. I've never met anyone remotely like Elon Musk."

Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin -- who said his own hypothetical text communication with Musk would "remain private" -- said that he and his colleagues were being coy about having Musk's number because they're "sensitive about people having access" and the potential for "abuse."

Then he also offered some unsolicited praise for Musk.

"I think he's a remarkable individual. He's probably one of the more brilliant, accomplished, effective human beings ever to walk the face of the Earth," Johnson said, adding that he's "very appreciative of the fact that he's willing to devote his very expensive time" to DOGE.

Wednesday's lunch with GOP senators was just one of several meetings that Musk has had with congressional Republicans in the last two weeks. Later that day, he met with a larger group of House Republicans, plus a smaller meeting with the Republicans on the DOGE subcommittee. That's on top of a meeting last Thursday with the Senate DOGE Caucus and a meeting on Tuesday night with House Speaker Mike Johnson.

It comes as some Republicans grow anxious about the lack of congressional input over DOGE's spending decisions, with some urging the White House to send federal spending cuts to Congress in the form of a "recission" bill, as required under the Impoundment Control Act. Sen. Johnson told BI he wanted to see votes on recissions "every few weeks."

For now, it appears that Musk is only giving out his cellphone number to senators. Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, the chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, told BI that Musk didn't read out his number during his meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday night.

"I probably would have been writing it down if he did," Harris said, even as he insisted that he didn't feel slighted. "He's readily available, he's a day-to-day person who's dedicated to bringing the Trump agenda to fruition. So I'm perfectly happy with that. I don't need a phone number."

Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, a Republican DOGE subcommittee member, told BI that he's "not going to comment" on whether he had Musk's number. But he also said he wouldn't be texting him.

"I'm not going to be one of those that bothers him," Burchett said.

Description: The House speaker's embrace of Musk's "algorithms" sounds almost spiritual -- as if he were speaking of some infallible, inhuman force.

Back in 2017, former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski garnered headlines when he formally established a religious group that worshipped artificial intelligence.

The so-called Way of the Future's mission is "to develop and promote the realization of a Godhead based on artificial intelligence and through understanding and worship of the Godhead contribute to the betterment of society." Sounds eerie, right? But it's not unique in being a spiritual ideology centered on technology. In the 1990s, the term "technopaganism" emerged as a definition for those who've made technology a centerpiece of their religious ethos.

All of this came to mind for me this week, when House Speaker Mike Johnson touted "algorithms" that Elon Musk is purportedly using to determine which parts of the federal government should be slashed.

"We meet late into the night in his office, and we've looked at that. What he's finding with his algorithms crawling through the data of Social Security system is enormous amounts of fraud, waste and abuse," Johnson told NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday.

Description: He is quite a character, that Elon Musk, believing it's true what the media says, that he is the richest person in the world. And now Elon Musk is behaving like he thinks he's President of the United States. And I believe it's fair for me to say that because I've been listening to Mr. Musk on the radio and watching him on television ordering, yes ordering, as only the president or someone empowered by the president can order hundreds of thousands of government employees to make and keep a record day by day, every day, a record of what a government employee is doing so that Musk and Trump can know when work time is being wasted and they can play politics with it. While those popular Tesla cars that Mr. Musk is producing and selling are being described by people who buy and drive them as dangerous. Windshield wipers and seat belts not working. Engine noises too loud and distracting. Escalating speeds too sudden and scary. Musk is collecting those records and firing thousands of government employees to the tune of Musk speeches about saving taxpayer dollars, while so many thousands more who are not being fired are now quitting their Tesla jobs. And I, as a reporter, Mr. Musk, am waiting to hear on the radio and to watch on TV whatever it is that you and your pal in the Oval Office of the White House are planning to do next.
